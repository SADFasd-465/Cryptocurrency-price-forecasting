Machine learning techniques can be used to create a prediction model for cryptocurrency prices. An approximate development plan would include:Data collection - you will need to obtain historical data on cryptocurrency prices, trading volumes and other relevant parameters.

Data preprocessing - normalising the data, filling in gaps and creating features.

Model training - use machine learning algorithms to create a model, such as regression, decision trees, or recurrent neural networks (RNN).

Model evaluation - checking the accuracy of the prediction and improving the model.
